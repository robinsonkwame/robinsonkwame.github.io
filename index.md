## About

Kwame Porter Robinson is a tireless, creative problem solver with a variety research interests, including human interaction with artificial intelligence (HIAI), [human-robot/AI interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction) (e.g. autonomous vehicles), human-AI teaming (e.g., virtual assistants), [generative economics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311811471_An_Introduction_to_Generative_Justice) and [natural language understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding) (NLU). He has a background in electrical engineering, control systems, machine learning and architecting computational systems. 

As a HIAI cognitive scientist his primary investigative techniques are experimental, quasi-experimental and simulation based. He largely uses quantitative and mixed-methods designs along with novel system development. Before academia he worked for 10 years in industry as CEO, research engineer, data scientist and machine learning engineer for both government and private corporations. Kwame is a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. He is advised by [Dr. Robert](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/lionelrobert/home) and [Dr. Eglash](https://generativejustice.org/).

## Graduate Student Instructor Courses
* [SI 671/721: Data Mining: Methods and Applications](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/umsi-class/671.pdf) - Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets. This is a doctoral seminar course of advanced topics in data mining. The course provides an overview of recent research topics in the field of data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems. 
* [SI 699: Big Data Analytics](https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/si_699-007.pdf) - The big data analytics mastery course will require students to demonstrate mastery of data collection,processing, analysis, visualization, and prediction. To develop these skills students will work onsemester-long projects that deal with large or industry-scale data sets, and solve real-world problems.Aligned with best industry practices, students will be expected to work in a fast-paced, collaborativeenvironment, while demonstrating independence and leadership. Students must be able to create and usetools to handle very large transactional, text, network, behavioral, and/or multimedia data sets.
