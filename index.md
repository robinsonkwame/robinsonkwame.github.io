## About

Kwame is a socio-technical action researcher. Multimodal machine learning coupled with mixed-method system designs is how he often takes action with others. Sustainable social and environmental relationships with human AI interaction are his areas of inquiry. His research projects include [generative economics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335391995_AI_for_a_Generative_Economy_The_Role_of_Intelligent_Systems_in_Sustaining_Unalienated_Labor_Environment_and_Society), product lifecycle assessment, and social justice in human AI interaction, particulary for robotics.

In his research, he develops interdisciplinary theory within case-based work across various problem domains. His primary investigative techniques are systems building, empirical study, and experimental designs. For evaluation he largely uses quantitative and mixed-methods methods. Prior to academia he worked for several years in industry as CEO, research engineer, data scientist and machine learning engineer for both government and private corporations. Kwame is a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. He is advised by [Dr. Robert](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/lionelrobert/home) and [Dr. Eglash](https://generativejustice.org/).

## Graduate Student Instructor Courses
* [SI 671/721: Data Mining: Methods and Applications](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/umsi-class/671.pdf) - (98 students) Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets. This is a doctoral seminar course of advanced topics in data mining. The course provides an overview of recent research topics in the field of data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems. 
* [SI 699: Big Data Analytics](https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/si_699-007.pdf) - (34 students) The big data analytics mastery course will require students to demonstrate mastery of data collection,processing, analysis, visualization, and prediction. To develop these skills students will work onsemester-long projects that deal with large or industry-scale data sets, and solve real-world problems.Aligned with best industry practices, students will be expected to work in a fast-paced, collaborativeenvironment, while demonstrating independence and leadership. Students must be able to create and usetools to handle very large transactional, text, network, behavioral, and/or multimedia data sets.

## Service
* [Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center (KAMSC)](https://kamsc.org/) - Keynote for Big Data Day; Presented principles and questions for effective analysis of big data to Kalamazoo High School students. Introduced Information as a discipline, the importance of theory, and contextualized learnings with a brief introduction of Authene-Kente (Robinson et al 2021). Slides [available here](https://github.com/robinsonkwame/robinsonkwame.github.io/blob/master/conf/KAMSC%20Big%20Data%20Day%20-%20Robinson%20-%201-13-2021.pdf).
* [Black at SI (B@SI)](https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/blackatsi) - One of several founding executive memebers. The Black@SI is an academic and social support network that serves Black students, alumni, and accomplices of the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI). Through our programming, we help ensure that underrepresented students can successfully contribute to both scientific research and the college’s learning environment, and positively impact our communities.
